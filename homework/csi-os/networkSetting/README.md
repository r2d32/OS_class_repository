All of your screenshots do show network information, but note that the Mac one does not show the exact equivalent of what you have in Linux and Windows.  The Mac screenshot only shows routing information.  There is a command other than `netstat` that shows this information more consistently.  Or, GUI screenshots of network settings or control panels would have been OK too.
